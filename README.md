# Tempest Redux

### Building

You must have the dependencies (SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf) installed.    

Create an empty folder and enter it.    

```
mkdir tempest-redux
cd tempest-redux
```

Then clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/XxrubygitxX/tempest-redux.git
```

After cloning, cd into the source code (or leave it be if you're already there) and make the project.

```
make
```
